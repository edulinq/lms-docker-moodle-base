# LMS Docker Image - Moodle Base

A [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) image running an instance of
[Moodle Learning Management System (LMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moodle).
This image has an blank instance of Moodle,
with the only additional information being the server owner account:
 - Username: `server-owner`
 - Email: `server-owner@test.edulinq.org`
 - Password: `server-owner`

## Usage

The docker image is fairly standard, and does not require special care when building:

For example, you can build an image with the tag `lms-docker-moodle-base` using:
```sh
docker build -t lms-docker-moodle-base .
```

Refer to the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to see any arguments that can be passed
(such as the server owner's credentials).

Once built, the container can be run using standard options.
This image uses port 4000 by default, so that port should be passed through:
```sh
# Using the previously built image.
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4080 --name moodle lms-docker-moodle-base

# Using the pre-built image.
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4080 --name moodle ghcr.io/edulinq/lms-docker-moodle-base
```

Moodle is very sensitive to the port used (even if you map a different port in Docker).
If you need to use another port, you may need to rebuild the image with your desired port.
For example:
```sh
docker build -t lms-docker-moodle-base-special-port --build-arg MOODLE_PORT=1234 .
```
